# GenCIM
Generalized Compilation and Simulation tool for SRAM-CIM Accelerator

1. CIMMA_Compiler: Input: hardware parameters and operator config; Output: the count of instruction states. Run the try.py in GenCIM/CIMMA_Compiler to test the compliation of instruction compiler (.c)

2. evaluator.py: simulate the accelerator PPA based on the power and area modeling. The power and area modeling are based on post-sim results.

Our evaluation and exploration are based on this flow.
